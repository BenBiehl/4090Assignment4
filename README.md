### Highlights

- **`app.py`** – Streamlit UI to interact with the to-do list.
- **`tasks.py`** – Contains the core logic for managing tasks.
- **`test/`** – Includes various test styles:
  - `test_basic.py`: Unit tests with `pytest`
  - `test_advanced.py`: Tests using fixtures & parameterization
  - `test_tdd.py`: Test-driven development example
  - `test_property.py`: Property-based testing with `hypothesis`
  - `features/`: BDD tests using `behave` or `pytest-bdd`, including feature files and steps

## Bugs and Fixes

- **`Title`** - #01 Incorrect ID
- **`Environment`** - All OS's, using streamlit command
- **`Steps to Reproduce`** - Run the app, and create and delete tasks
- **`Priority`** - Minor, doesn't mess up core functionality

### Code Before and After

```python

new_task = {
    "id": len(tasks) + 1,
    ...

```

Before a new id was being generated by using the length. To fix this, I just used the
generate_unqiue_id function that was already created.

```python

# Function
def generate_unique_id(tasks):
    if not tasks:
        return 1
    return max(task["id"] for task in tasks) + 1

# Fix
new_task = {
    "id": generate_unique_id(tasks),
    ...
```

- **`Title`** - #02 Reused variable
- **`Environment`** - All OS's, using streamlit command
- **`Steps to Reproduce`** - Run the app, and create and delete tasks
- **`Priority`** - Medium, overriding variables could lead to functinoality breaking

### Code Before and After

```python

# Variables assigned
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

# Same variables being used again later
for task in filtered_tasks:
    col1, col2 = st.columns([4, 1])

```

To fix the overriding of the original variables, I just created new variables to be
used during the task filtering.

```python

# Variables assigned
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

# New variables assigned
for task in filtered_tasks:
    task_col1, task_col2 = st.columns([4, 1])

```

- **`Title`** - #03 Incorrect Checking before submitting task
- **`Environment`** - All OS's, using streamlit command
- **`Steps to Reproduce`** - Run the app, and create a task without filling out fields
- **`Priority`** - High, could lead to significant problems if not fixed

### Code Before and After

```python

# Only checked if there was a title
if submit_button and task_title:

```

Before the code only checked if there was a title. Without the other parameters
the filtering and sorting could be messed up, so I changed it to check that all
fields are filled, otherwise it doesn't submit.

```python

# Now checks all fields
if submit_button and task_title and task_description and task_priority and task_category and task_due_date:
...
# And gives error if they aren't all filled
else:
    st.sidebar.error("Please fill in all required fields.")

```
